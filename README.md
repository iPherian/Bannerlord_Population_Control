# Purpose

This mod helps to deal with often low food supplies and garisson deaths related to prosperity in settlements.

You can reduce the prosperity (called population in the mod) of a holding as much as you like. However, it also reduces loyalty proportionally. For example, if you reduce population by 100 and this is 10% of it, loyalty goes down by 10% as well.

Alternatively, if you enable `cheat_mode = 1`, you can reduce or increase prosperity without negative effects and in any settlement.

# Installation

You can get it from nexus: https://www.nexusmods.com/mountandblade2bannerlord/mods/259/

Or, if you're building it here, during post build, the Module directory will be mirrored to the Bannerlord module directory (`C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Mount & Blade II Bannerlord\Modules\PopulationControl`). It may be necessary to set the property `GameFolder` if Bannerlord is installed at a non-standard path.

## Class overrides:

None
